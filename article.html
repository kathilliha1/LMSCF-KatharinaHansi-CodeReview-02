				<h2>Nasa</h2>
				<p>Wild theories of sabotage still persist two weeks after a mysterious pressure leak occurred on the International Space Station, and the gossip has gotten so nonsensical that both NASA and Russia’s state space corporation, Roscosmos, are now trying to quell the rumors.

				In a joint statement released today, NASA and Roscosmos claim that the US space agency is working closely with Russia to figure out the cause of the leak. The statement also notes that no information will be released until the Russian-led investigation is over, despite rampant speculation in the Russian press that the leak was possibly caused by one of NASA’s astronauts in space.</p>

				<h2>EU</h2>
				<p>The European Parliament has voted in favor of the Copyright Directive, a controversial piece of legislation intended to update online copyright laws for the internet age.

				The directive was originally rejected by MEPs in July following criticism of two key provisions: Articles 11 and 13, dubbed the “link tax” and “upload filter” by critics. However, in parliament this morning, an updated version of the directive was approved, along with amended versions of Articles 11 and 13. The final vote was 438 in favor and 226 against.


				The fallout from this decision will be far-reaching, and take a long time to settle. The directive itself still faces a final vote in January 2019 (although experts say it’s unlikely it will be rejected). After that it will need to be implemented by individual EU member states, who could very well vary significantly in how they choose to interpret the directive’s text.

				The most important parts of this are Articles 11 and 13. Article 11 is intended to give publishers and papers a way to make money when companies like Google link to their stories, allowing them to demand paid licenses. Article 13 requires certain platforms like YouTube and Facebook stop users sharing unlicensed copyrighted material.</p>

				<h2>Jeff Bezos</h2>
				<p>A year after asking for suggestions on philanthropy, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is unveiling his first projects. The highlight will be the creation of a network for nonprofit preschools that are to be built in low-income communities and accept students at no charge.

				Bezos also intends to fund existing nonprofits that help homeless families by providing access to housing and food. Both initiatives will be overseen by something he’s calling the Bezos Day One Fund, which he’s committing $2 billion toward.

				Each of the initiatives will have a specific group behind it: the Day 1 Families Fund and the Day 1 Academies Fund. The Families Fund will issue grants on a yearly basis to organizations doing “needle-moving work.” The Academies Fund will be in charge of launching and operating a network of schools entirely on its own. Bezos says they’ll be “high-quality” Montessori-inspired schools that offer “full scholarship,” seemingly to all students.</p>

				<h2>Polar watches</h2>
				<p>Polar announced two new workout trackers today: the more expensive Vantage V and the cheaper Vantage M companion. Let’s start with the bigger, more expensive watch. The Vantage V costs $499.90 and includes a new optical heart rate sensor with nine LEDs along two different wavelengths (green and red). This, the company says, should make its heart rate readings more accurate.

				The biggest addition to the watch is its power measurements for running. This is a relatively new metric, but you might recognize it because of products like Stryd. It essentially measures a wearer’s work output, similar to how cyclists measure their watts generated. Runners likely will appreciate this for training purposes. It doesn’t support LTE, although it does have a built-in GPS. It charges over a custom charger and should last for 40 hours of sports activity time, Polar says. It’s also water and swim-proof. The watch features a 1.2-inch, 240 x 240 touchscreen that’ll turn off once wearers enter their workout mode. It’s available in white, black, and orange.</p>

				<h2>Elon Musk</h2>
				<p>Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has smoked marijuana live on the web during a podcast with comedian Joe Rogan. Mr Rogan offered his guest the drug, which is legal in California, as the pair discussed tech innovation and the public's perception of Mr Musk. "I mean, it's legal, right?" asked the Tesla founder, before taking a drag on the joint. Tesla shares fell more than nine per cent following Mr Musk's appearance on the show. BBC business correspondent Kim Gittleson says the podcast appearance coupled with the departure of a key executive who blamed increasing public scrutiny of the company for his decision to leave has shaken investor confidence in Tesla. Last month, Mr Musk said he was not "on weed" when he tweeted about plans to make the electric car company a private firm. The business leader made the comments in an interview with the New York Times. He also told the newspaper he works "120-hour weeks" and takes sedatives.</p>

				<h2>Snowden</h2>
				<p>The UK's bulk interception powers, exposed by the whistleblower Edward Snowden, have been found to be illegal by the European Court of Human Rights. In a landmark judgement, the court ruled agencies had violated rights as there were no proper safeguards. The court crucially said bulk interception was legitimate and it had seen no evidence it had been abused. Parliament reformed surveillance powers in 2016 and introduced a new watchdog. Critics say the system is still flawed.</p>
